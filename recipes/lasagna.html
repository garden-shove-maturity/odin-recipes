        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian baked dish made by layering wide,</p>
        <p>flat pasta sheets with rich tomato sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta,</p>
        <p>and savory fillings such as seasoned ground meat, vegetables, and</p>
        <p>cheese—typically mozzarella and Parmesan. Each layer melds together</p> 
        <p>in the oven, creating a comforting, hearty meal with a perfect balance</p> 
        <p>of textures: tender pasta, smooth sauce, and a golden, bubbling top.</p> 
        <p>Loved around the world, lasagna is both rustic and indulgent, often</p> 
        <p>served as the centerpiece of family gatherings or cozy dinners.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Lasagna noodles (pasta sheets)</li>
            <li>Ground beef or Italian sausage</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce (or marinara)</li>
            <li>Ricotta or béchamel sauce</li>
            <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the sauce - Cook ground beef or sausage with onions, garlic, and tomato sauce, then let it simmer to develop flavor.</li>
            <li>Boil the noodles - Cook lasagna sheets until just tender (or use no-boil noodles if preferred).</li>
            <li>Mix the cheese layer - Combine ricotta (or cottage cheese) with egg, herbs, and a bit of Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Assemble the layers - In a baking dish, alternate layers of sauce, noodles, cheese mixture, and mozzarella until filled.</li>
            <li>Bake - Cover with foil and bake until bubbling, then uncover to let the top brown and cheese melt beautifully.</li>
        </ol>
