        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A burrito is a popular Mexican dish consisting of a large flour tortilla wrapped around a hearty filling</p>
        <p>of rice, beans, meat, cheese, and various seasonings. Often enhanced with salsa, guacamole, or sour</p>
        <p>cream, the burrito is rolled tightly into a portable bundle that’s both satisfying and flavorful. Its</p>
        <p>versatility allows for endless variations—from classic beef and bean burritos to fresh vegetarian or</p> 
        <p>breakfast versions—making it a convenient and beloved meal around the world.</p>
